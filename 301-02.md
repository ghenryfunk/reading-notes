# Read 02 JQuery, Events, and the DOM (Ducket book pg 293-301, 306-331, 354-367)

## JQuery allows us to more easily
  - *Select Elements* using CSS-style selectors that are more powerful and flexible than previously used JavaScript DOM queries
  - *Perform Tasks* like updating the DOM tree, animating elements into and out of view, and looping through a set of elements all in one line of code!
  - *Handle Events* with methods that allow you to attach event listeners to selected elements without having to write fallback code to support older browsers 

- * You must add a \<script>\</script> tag to the bottom of your html's body section but just ABOVE the \<script> tag housing the JS src.

- JavaScript can do everything JQuery does already. But JQuery simplifies the code:
  ## "Write Less, Do More"

* pg 302-305 great reference guide for 
  1. finding elements
  1. doing things with your selection

- When you create a selection w/ JQuery (like $('li') for example) you are not creating a new \<li> (unless you are... more on that later) you are simply storing a reference to that elements corresponding node(s) in the DOM tree.

- When setting or manipulating elements w/ JQuery, you don't need to write a loop (necessarily) like you would do w/ vanilla JavaScript, as JQuery will simply target ALL instances of the targeted element.
  - ex.     $('li[id != "one"]').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(1400);
    - this will hide and then delay a fan in for all \<li>s without id="one"

- You can GET element content by keeping the () empty 
  - ex. $('ul').html(); // gets the child elements of the \<ul> tag
  - .html()
  - .text()

- You can UPDATE element content (just pass new content into the ()'s)
  - .html('newcontent')
  - .text('newcontent')
  - .replaceWith('newcontent')
  - .remove('oldcontent')

- You can GET and SET attribute values:
  - .attr()
  - .removeAttr()
  - .addClass()
  - .removeClass()

- To CREATE a new element using JQuery (pg 319)
  - Two steps:
    1. Create the new element in a JQuery object
      - ex. let $newItem = $('\<li class="new">Item\</li>');
    1. Add the new element to the page
      - ex. .before() .after() .prepend() .append()

## .forEach
- Even though JQuery targets ALL specified elements, you might still need to LOOP through elements to
  1. Get information from each element in the matched set
  1. Perform a series of actions on each of the elements

  - ex. arr.forEach(() => { //execute something });

- The .forEach method calls a provied callback function which takes 1-3 arguments
  1. The *value* of the element
  1. the *index* of the element
  1. the *array object* being traversed 

  - ex. arr.forEach((value, i) => { //execute something });

## .on()
- The .on() method is used to handle all events in JQuery. It takes 2 parameters
  1. The event you want it to respond to
  1. The code you want to run when that event occurs
  - ex. $('li').on('click', function() {<br>
      $(this).addClass('complete');<br>
  }); <br>// This adds the class="complete" to any 'li' that is clicked

  - Remember that Event objects are passed into every Event Handling function whether you write 'event', 'e', or nothing!

- You can add additional optional paramters for Event Handlers
  - If a parameter is shown in square brackets [] that means it is optional

  - ex. .on('focus click' [, selector][, data], function(e));
