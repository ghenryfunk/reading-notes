# Functional Programing Concepts
(https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

- Pure Functions: return the same result if given the same arguements. They don't cause any side effects

- Immutable Data: data whose state cannot change after it's created

- Referentially transparent functions - if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input

pure functions + immutable data = referential transperancy 

- Functions as first class entities can:
  - refer to it from constants and variables
  - pass it as a parameter to either functions
  - return it as a result from either functions

- Higher-Order functions
  - Takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result
