## Transform property CSS
- The transform property allows us to manipulate objects in either 2D or 3D
    - transform: rotate(20edg); (this will rotate the image clockwise, while a negative value rotates counterclockwise)
    - transform: scale(1.25); (this will enlarge the image, while a value between 0 and 1 will shrink the image. You can also scale x and y axis indepdendently like transform: scale(.5, 1.15);)
    - transform: translate(-10px, 10px); this will move the image to the left and up

## Transitions and animations
- transistions only occur when an element has a change of state (think refreshing the page)
    - easiest way to determine styles for different states is by using CSS pseudo classes: :hover, :active, :focus, and :target
- there are 4 transition related properties
    1. transition-property
    1. transition-duration
    1. transition-timing-function
    1. transition-delay

- animations are a whole other ballgame...
    - look up card flip for a cool animation you might actually use!

- fade in is also a cool transition
