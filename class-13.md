# Local Storage
- HTML5 is trying to eliminate the need for third-party plugins and allow a "standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers"
- before using the 'localStorage' object, make sure the browser you're using supports it
- HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs
    - it is stored as a string, regardless of what data type it is
- To keep track of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event
- This is an evolving field, but HTML5 seems to have more consensus regarding local storage than any past iterations - stay tuned!
